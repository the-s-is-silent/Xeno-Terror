# Xeno Terror
Basically "The Barbarians" but for Alpha Frontier. Xeno Hives now award crash site effects... *if* you can clear them out.

Xeno units gain an additional 33% combat bonus when attacking any unit, along with another 33% bonus while they are close to their hive. However, the wider variety of crash site bonuses offers persevering colonists a chance to turn the tide against the Xeno threat.
