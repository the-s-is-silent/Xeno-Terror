## 1.1.0 (04/21/2024)
- Buffed Xeno UA as follows:
    - Xeno Air units gain +1 Sight/Movement
    - Xeno units are no longer required to pillage tiles to heal
    - Xeno units gain a healing bonus when close to a xeno hive
    - The range for the strength bonus when close to a xeno hive was increased to 3 tiles
- Added new Xeno units:
    - Miasma Menace (Tier 1 Melee Land, 5 strength, 2 base movement, obsoletes at Next-Gen Armaments, no terrain penalties, +50% strength in Miasma or Artificial Miasma, has a 1-in-3 chance on death to spawn 3 more copies of itself, turns the tile where it was killed into Miasma)
    - Wendigo Colossus (Tier 3 Melee Land, 50 strength, 5 base movement, starts with Ignore terrain cost, Bloodthirst and Frenzy, +33% strength when attacking cities, recovers 20 HP for each unit it kills, cannot be captured)
    - Bladehead Racer (Tier 3 Air, 45 strength, 4 base movement, starts with Ignore terrain cost, Bloodthirst, Spike I and Wings I, 1-in-4 chance to intercept air attacks, +30% strength bonus against Mechs and Drones, cannot be captured)
- The XP cap from combat with Xenos has been increased high enough that there may as well not be a cap.
- The ruins bonus "multiple cryopods" now adds +1 population to all owned cities (was previously +3 in a random city, then +3 in capital).
- The ruins bonus "infernal training" is renamed to "training from hell" and its availability is delayed by 10 turns, now unlocking after turn 40 (previously unlocked after turn 30).

## 1.0.1 (02/28/2024)
- Various adjustments to several of the added ruins effects in the vein of my DeCiv Redux expansion/rebalance mod "Outlaws of the Wastes", along with deleting the one that awarded a bonus Pantheon belief

## 1.0.0 (02/21/2024)
- Initial release, but as usual for me, had some problems that needed immediate correction
